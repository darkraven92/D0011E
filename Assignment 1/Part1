Part 1. 
     _______
    |       |
A --|       |
    |  Full |------ S
B --|  Adder|------ Cout
Ci--|       |
    |_______|

The inputs are A, B, and Ci (carry-in), and the outputs are S (sum) and Cout (carry-out).

Note that this is just a basic schematic and there are many ways to implement a one-bit full adder using different logic gates.
